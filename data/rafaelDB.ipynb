    "\n",
    "## Observações importantes:\n",
    "1. Sempre organize o conteúdo utilizando células markdown e seções. Também utilize células de texto para escrever sua análise das figuras que forem geradas.\n",
    "2. Lembre-se que essa primeira célula deve ter informação suficiente para entender o que foi feito e quais conclusões você chegou, sem ter que ler o notebook inteiro. Isso agiliza muito a busca por informações ao longo do projeto. Além disso, seu eu do futuro (ou novas pessoas que entrem no projeto) vai agradecer se o seu notebook estiver bem escrito e completo."
